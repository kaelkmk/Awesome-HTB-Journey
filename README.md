HTB Journey Starter List <br/>

A list for those who want to own boxes but don't know what to start. <br/>

Back in 2017, I was on a Basic Web Security Course and could register in HTB. But after using a<br/>
exploit script via metasploit and got a foothold shell, I don't know what to do, how to enumerate, <br/>
how to priv escalate. So, I felt down and go back my university studies for almost 3 years and learned <br/>
many many things. I feel like I should have own boxes since 2017 if I knew what to do. I won't let that <br/>
happen to newbies nowadays. I collected information as much as I could for you guys ^^

You can also help me by making pull requests to add some more information
